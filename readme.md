**NOTE:** To finish setting up this project, I think you'll probably have to
add the Processing core library path to the project's `classpath`. In
IntelliJ IDEA menus, go to File → Project Structure... → Modules →
Dependencies. From there, click the "+" button and select "JARs or
Directories...". Specify "/path/to/processing/core/library".
